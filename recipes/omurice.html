        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Fried Rice Fiesta: Cook rice, then saut√© diced veggies and protein in butter or oil. Stir in ketchup, salt, and pepper for tangy goodness.</li>

            <li>Egg Embrace: Whisk eggs with milk or cream for extra fluff. Heat butter in a pan until swirling (medium-low heat is key!).</li>

            <li>Pour with Patience: Tilt the pan and slowly pour in half the egg mixture. Tilt and swirl to form a thin layer. Let edges set.</li>

            <li>Rice Reunion: Spoon hot rice onto the cooked omelette half. Fold the other half over with a spatula, gently shaping into an oval.</li>

            <li>Ketchup Canvas: Draw playful swirls of ketchup on top with a spoon. Let your inner artist out!</li>

            <li>Serve with Smiles: Slide onto a plate, garnish with parsley or chives (optional), and savor the fluffy fusion.</li>
